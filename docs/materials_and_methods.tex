Tahir:

Having finalized your research question and study regions, you can now focus on the Materials and Methods section, which involves identifying the types of datasets needed and exploring suitable statistical methods and tools for data analysis. I will help you download the required genome-wide SNP data for accessions from Spain and Sweden as a VCF file from https://1001genomes.org/data/GMI-MPI/releases/v3.1/.

If you need climate data, it can be downloaded from https://www.worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html. Donâ€™t forget to identify any additional datasets needed and their potential sources before starting the analysis. We encourage you to contact us with any additional questions, and we are here to guide you throughout the process of designing and executing your research project.
